# Courses App 

This project is a Courses App developed using Flutter and Firebase. The app provides features for students to rate and provide feedback for each course, while instructors can add new courses and upload course materials.

## Features

- Student Ratings and Feedback: Students can rate and provide feedback for each course they have enrolled in. This allows for an interactive and informative platform where students can share their experiences and insights with others.

- Instructor Course Management: Instructors have the ability to add new courses to the app. They can also upload course materials such as lecture slides, assignments, and additional resources for the enrolled students to access.

## Usage

1. Set up Flutter and Firebase: Ensure you have Flutter and Firebase SDK installed and configured on your development environment.

2. Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

3. Configure Firebase: Set up a Firebase project and configure the necessary Firebase services, such as Authentication and Firestore (for database functionality).

4. Update Firebase Configuration: Update the Firebase configuration in the Flutter project to connect the app with your Firebase project. This typically involves updating the Firebase initialization code in the `main.dart` file.

5. Design UI: Design the user interface (UI) of the app using Flutter widgets. Create screens for course listings, student ratings, feedback forms, instructor course management, and other relevant screens.

6. Implement Firebase Integration: Implement the necessary Firebase integration code to handle user authentication, data storage, and retrieval. This includes handling user authentication, storing and retrieving course information, ratings, feedback, and course materials in Firestore.

7. Test and Debug: Test the app thoroughly to ensure proper functionality and debug any issues that arise. Use Flutter's debugging tools to identify and fix any errors or unexpected behavior.

8. Build and Deploy: Build the Flutter app and deploy it to your desired platform (Android, iOS, or web). Follow the official Flutter documentation for detailed instructions on building and deploying your app.
